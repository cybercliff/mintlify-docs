## Step 1: Open Payment Gateway Settings

1. Login to [mychaiclub.com](https://mychaiclub.com) and navigate to **Settings** in the menu
2. Scroll to the **Payment Gateways** section
3. Select your preferred payment gateway

## Step 2: Retrieve Your API Keys

  <Accordion title="Stripe" icon="stripe">
    [Login to Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login). If you don't have a Stripe account, you can [create one here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). Make sure your account is live and activated before proceeding. If your account is not live, an orange warning banner will usually appear at the top.

    ### What You Need

    - **Publishable Key**
    - **Restricted Key** (a secret key with limited permissions for security)

    <Note>
      Stripe's interface updates frequently, so your screen may differ slightly from these instructions. See the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) for additional help. The key requirement is granting write permissions for the items listed in step 7.

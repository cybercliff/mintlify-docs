You can use our hosted campaign page (e.g., [mychaiclub.com/jewishsv](https://mychaiclub.com/jewishsv)) to share your campaign directly.

## How to Change Your Slug

[Open a support ticket](/support) and send us your desired slug.

**Important:** Please request a specific slug based on your organization name rather than a general one (e.g., `/chabad` or `/donate`).

## Already Have a Website?

You can also embed your campaign on your existing website in addition to or instead of the hosted page. See instructions here for [embed your campaign](/embed-campaign).

Donors can create an account to manage their membership details.

## How It Works

After becoming a member, donors receive a thank you email prompting them to create an account or login to manage their membership. Donors can also import their membership using their email address.

## What Donors Can Do

- View organization details
- View all membership details
- Edit donation amount
- Change day of month charged
- Cancel membership

## Prompt a Donor to Create an Account

If a donor hasn't created an account yet, you can send them a prompt:

1. Login to [mychaiclub.com](https://mychaiclub.com) and navigate to **Members** in the top menu
2. Click on the member
3. Under **Member Details**, find the "Member has account" section
4. Click **Send email to link account**

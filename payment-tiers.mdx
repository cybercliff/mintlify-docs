Tiers act as suggested donation amounts and group members by recognition level. Changing a tier amount will not affect existing donations but may move members to a different tier.

<Note>
Members can donate any amount, even below the lowest tier. They just won't be publicly recognized unless their amount matches a tier.

## Choosing Tier Amounts

Tier amounts depend on your organization and donor financial levels. Here are a few tips:

- **Set expectations** - Higher tiers encourage larger donations
- **Public recognition** - Only donors who match tier amounts are publicly recognized
- **Keep it simple** - Stick to 3-4 tiers so donors don't overthink
- **Use existing data** - If you have current donors, set tiers to recognize the top 70%
